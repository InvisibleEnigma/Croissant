    <h1>🥐 Croissants from the Fakery</h1>
    <h2>The non-existent bakery</h2>
    <p>
      The croissant, often seen as a classic French pastry, actually has its
      roots in Austria. Austrian bakers in the 13th century crafted a
      crescent-shaped pastry known as the "kipferl." By the 19th century, this
      pastry made its way to France, where bakers transformed it into the
      croissant we recognise today. French bakers used laminated dough, layering
      it with butter to achieve the delicate, flaky texture that defines the
      modern croissant. Making croissants involves a meticulous process called
      laminating. This technique requires folding butter into dough multiple
      times, creating thin layers that result in the pastry’s light, airy
      structure and crisp crust. After shaping the dough into its iconic
      crescent, it’s left to proof, allowing the flavours to develop and the
      pastry to rise. Finally, it’s baked to golden perfection, showcasing the
      rich layers and buttery taste that have made it loved worldwide
